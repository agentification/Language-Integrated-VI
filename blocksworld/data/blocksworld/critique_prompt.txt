I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.

You will be given the history of a past experience in which I was placed in an environment and given a task to complete. I was unsuccessful in completing the task. Do not summarize the environment, but rather think about the strategy and path I took to attempt to complete the task. Find the actions account for my mistake with reference to specific actions that I should have taken. For example, if I tried A and B but forgot C, then tell me that I forgot C. For example, if I first did a seemingly correct action A, then I could not achieve my goal because A becomes an obstruction to the goal. I will need this later when I am solving the same task. Check the actions one by one and explain the sequential causal effect. For example, you could think ACTION n is the first mistake but ACTION n-1 is already wrong. Mind the sequential causal effect between actions.

[SCENARIO 1]
[GOAL] My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the red block.
[STATE 0] I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
[ACTION 1] Pick up the blue block.
[STATE 1] I have that, the blue block is in the hand, the orange block is clear, the red block is clear, the hand is holding the blue block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.
[ACTION 2] Stack the blue block on top of the orange block.
[STATE 2] I have that, the blue block is clear, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on the table, and the yellow block is on the table.
[ACTION 3] Pick up the red block.
[STATE 3] I have that, the blue block is clear, the red block is in the hand, the hand is holding the red block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table.
[ACTION 4] Stack the red block on top of the blue block.
[STATE 4] I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the red block is on top of the blue block, and the yellow block is on the table.
[ACTION 5] Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block.
[STATE 5] I have that, the blue block is clear, the red block is in the hand, the hand is holding the red block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, and the yellow block is on the table.
[CRITIC] Your end goal is to have the blue block on top of the yellow block and the orange block on top of the red block. Starting from the initial state, the first obstruction to this goal is the position of the orange block, which is on top of the yellow block. Before stacking the blue block on the yellow one, it is essential to first remove the orange block. Instead, your first two actions ACTION 1 and ACTION 2 involved picking up the blue block and then stacking it on top of the already misplaced orange block. This was your primary mistake as it created a tower of blocks that obstructed both of your primary objectives. Given the state after ACTION 2, you attempted to stack the red block on this tower, which didn't align with the goal. Unstacking it later ACTION 5 just brings you back to a state similar to STATE 3, with no progress made toward the goal.
